# Spinning

Programmatically generated artwork in great swirling circles.
Algorithm: Each pixel stores a color and a center.
Repeat: Generate a random color. Find most similar color already placed.
Walk around the circle generated by that pixel and its center.
If find an open spot, store color there, randomly tweak the center a small amount.
If no open spot, place in random open pixel.

![Rainbow programmatic art. Big brushstrokes sweeping circularly from bottom left to top right and vice-versa,
as well as many smaller circles.](img-1000-20-1000-0.5-0.1-19.png)
